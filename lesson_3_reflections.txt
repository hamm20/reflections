When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? 

   You should use a remote repository if you are going to be collaborating with others, you could also use it
   as a another backup source. Remote repository is a must if you plan to share your work with others. Another reason to 
   use remote repository is if you work remotely from different computers.  This would allow you to work on your project.
