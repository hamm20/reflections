What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    
    When you initialize a repo, a .git file is created. This file is needed since it is used to 
    store metadata about the history of the repo. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you 
think it offers? 

    The staging area is where you add files from your working directory to prepare/stage for committing 
    to the repository. It's the intermediary between the working directory/files and repository. The value
    it offers is to probably to offer more flexibility and control.
